Implementation of a non-clairvoyant scheduler based on the sandpile
model in order to acquire organic system properties such as self-organization of tasks
or self-healing under resource failures. The aim is studying the viability of the approach
in terms of makespan performances when tackling DAGs. Here it has to be noted the
novelty of the model proposal and the relevance of approaching other state of the art
algorithms. Even if performances are barely equivalent, our proposal provides a
dynamic way of rescheduling tasks and does not rely on knowledge of the problem.
